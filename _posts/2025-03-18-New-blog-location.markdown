Welcome to my new blog location!

My old blog can be found at [https://anarsoul.blogspot.com](https://anarsoul.blogspot.com)

The main motivation to move to github pages is that blogger seems to be abandoned and doesn't support neither markdown or code blocks properly.

I am planning to post my thoughts here from time to time. I will also use it for keeping cheat sheets :)
